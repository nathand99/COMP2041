comments: started coding legit-init

4/7/19  11:00pm 12:30am coding      
started thinking about and coding add and commit. They probably dont
work but I haven't tested it 

6/7/19  1:00pm  3:00pm  coding      
Finished coding add, commit. They both work if you dont try and 
break it. Also edited init so it makes an index and commit directory
to help organise .legit a bit better. Commit puts the commit message
in a text file called message.txt. Started working on log

6/7/19  8:00pm  9:30pm  coding      
Finished coding log. I think it works

7/7/19  1:30pm  3:30pm  coding      
Started and finished coding show. It works if you dont try and break it. Started work on rm

8/7/19  1:30pm  4:00pm  coding      
Continued on rm and didnt finish and started on status by writing a 
giant comment

9/7/19  12:30pm 1:30pm  fixing      
Started detecting and handling errors with init, add, commit such as
needing a .legit directory to commit and add

13/7/19 8:00pm  9:30pm  fixing      
Re-wrote legit-log because it doesn't work anymore for some reason 
(even though it worked before)

14/7/19 11:30am 9:45pm  fixing/coding (DUE DATE) (10:00pm)
Went through all of subset 0 programs and tested them a lot with
all sorts of things to try and break it and try to catch and handle
errors like the 2041 legit- program does. 
Legit-add needed to check filenames were valid. Commit needed to handle command line args better and fixed a few bugs. -a option doesnt look like it works, but it passes the autotest . Added in "nothing to commit" functionality for when there is nothing in the index and when nothing has changed from the last commit. Log needed to check command line args and there was also a bug to be fixed when it cat's. Show needed to be re-written. It used find a lot which was annoying and hard to fix so changed all finds to test -e/-d. Also added in a lot of error checking for show so it should go alright.
Commit with -a works now and rm works if you dont try and break it. Theres not enough time to do status. 
Finished writing test scripts and now finishing writing this at 9:45. Goodbye
ps: BTW i saw on the github link that theres some legit-####.sh scripts from ages ago. I can't get rid of them but ignore any legit scripts with a .sh at the end. Now I have to give again
ps2: i deleted them its alright
